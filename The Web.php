<h1>The Web</h1>

<p>The web is information.  Almost anything that you could ever want to know is a couple of keystrokes and a few clicks away.  To me that is amazing.  Gone are the days of card catalogs and almanacs, and here to stay are Google and Wikipedia.  The best part of this information is that it is immediate.  You want tot know what a score is?  Open the ESPN app.  Want to know what the population of Morocco is? Google it.  Want to know what Donald Trump did today?  Check Twitter.  The  web is information - soak it up.</p>

<p>The web is community.  It can used to find long lost friends, to find love, or even just somebody to talk to.  Social media has taken this sphere to the next level.  People are willing to put themselves out there, and others are willing to consume it.  I am always amazed when I type something obscure into Google and it is able to auto-fill exactly what I am thinking.  The web is community - you are never alone.</p>

<p>The web is amazing.  I don't care how many videos I watch, or articles I read, on how the internet works, I still cannot wrap my head around how it actually works. And works so well for that matter.  I get that you can send a package via UPS from New York to Los Angeles, and it can get there in less than a week.  But how on Earth can you send an email from Shanghai to London and it be there in less than a second.  Little packets of data can be disassembled, travel 5,700 miles, stopping at who knows how many locations, and reassembled and viewed properly in the same amout of time that it takes to yawn.  The web is amazing - enough said.</p>
