		<h1>The Joys of Coding</h1>

		<p>Six weeks into this journey that is Omaha Code School, I can honestly say that coding is fun.  It is especially fun when you set out to accomplish a task, struggle for awhile, and then get it accomplished.  I feel a sense of accomplishment even when I get the smallest of things to work the way they are supposed to.</p>

		<p>I feel like I am improving each day.  When I look back on where I started, I have come a long way in a short amount of time.  With that being said, I know there is a lot to improve upon.  I need to increase my speed and efficiency.  I can improve on the basic fundamentals as well.  I need to get in the habit of writing comments and writing tests in addition to just getting something to work.</p>  
  
		<p>Besides fun, coding is several other things as well.  First of all it is challenging.  It has been a while since I have done this much thinking, pondering, and contemplating.  There was definitely not as much critical and logical thinking at my previous job.  I believe that I am a smart guy and I welcome these challenges.</p> 

		<p>Coding can be frustrating as well.  There is a lot to keep track of with the various languages, frameworks, new vocabulary, etc that we have used in class.  I was very much a novice coming into this class, there is a lot to know.  A tiny mistake, like a misspelled word or a missing semicolon, can mean the difference between something working flawlessly or getting the “White Screen of Death.”  You have to pay attention to the details.</p> 

		<p>I look forward to what the final six weeks have in store for the class.  I look forward to extending my knowledge base and working on my deficiencies in order to make the most of this amazing opportunity.</p>
